This directory is intended for custom static content (images, CSS files, HTML
files etc.) used to implement new pages or override existing stock static
content files.

To customize the content of the stock pages, copy files from the
config/velocity/statics directory to the analogous subdirectory here and make
changes to the copied file.  By default, files here will override those in the
config directory.
