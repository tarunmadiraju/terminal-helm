* encrypt-file.bat
     Encrypt or decrypt data using a key generated from a user-supplied
     passphrase, a key generated from an encryption settings definition, or a
     key shared among servers in the topology.  The data to be processed can be
     read from a file or standard input, and the resulting data can be written
     to a file or standard output.  You can use this command to encrypt and
     subsequently decrypt arbitrary data, or to decrypt encrypted backups, LDIF
     exports, and log files generated by the server.


* encryption-settings.bat
     Manage the server encryption settings database.


* enter-lockdown-mode.bat
     Request that the Directory Server enter lockdown mode, during which it

     simple paged results control.


* identify-unique-attribute-conflicts.bat
     This tool may be used to identify unique attribute conflicts.  That is, it
     may identify values of one or more attributes which are supposed to exist
     only in a single entry but are found in multiple entries.


* import-ldif.bat
     Import LDIF data into a Directory Server backend.


* indent-ldap-filter.bat
     Parses a provided LDAP filter string and displays it a multi-line form
     that makes it easier to understand its hierarchy and embedded components.
     If possible, it may also be able to simplify the provided filter in
     certain ways (for example, by removing unnecessary levels of hierarchy,
     like an AND embedded in an AND).

     the DNs of the entries to delete using named arguments, as trailing
     arguments, from a file, or from standard input.  Alternatively, you can
     identify entries to delete using a search base DN and filter.


* ldapmodify.bat
     Apply a set of add, delete, modify, and/or modify DN operations to a
     directory server.  Supply the changes to apply in LDIF format, either from
     standard input or from a file specified with the 'ldifFile' argument.
     Change records must be separated by at least one blank line.

     with a server instance running on the local system.


* make-ldif.bat
     Generate LDIF data based on a definition in a template file. For example
     template files, see the server's config/MakeLDIF directory. In particular,
     the examples-of-all-tags.template file shows how to use all of the tags
     for generating values.


* manage-account.bat
     Retrieve or update information about the current state of a user account.
     Processing will be performed using the password policy state extended

* re-encode-entries.bat
     Re-encode all or a specified portion of the entries in a local DB backend.


* rebuild-index.bat
     Rebuild index data within a backend based on the Berkeley DB Java Edition.
     Note that this tool uses different approaches to rebuilding indexes based
     on whether it is running in online mode (as a task) rather than with the
     server offline.  Running in offline mode will often provide significantly
     better performance and require significantly less database cleaning,
     particularly for indexes containing keys that match a large number of
     entries and have high index entry limit and exploded index entry threshold
     values.  Also note that rebuilding an index with the server online will
     prevent the server from using that index while the rebuild is in progress,
     so some searches may behave differently while a rebuild is active than
     when it is not.


* register-yubikey-otp-device.bat
     Registers a YubiKey OTP device with the Directory Server for a specified
     user so that the device may be used to authenticate that user in
     conjunction with the UNBOUNDID-YUBIKEY-OTP SASL mechanism.  Alternately,
     it may be used to deregister one or more YubiKey OTP devices for a user so
     that they may no longer be used to authenticate that user.

* rotate-log.bat
     Trigger the rotation of one or more log files.


* sanitize-log.bat
     Sanitize the contents of a server log file to remove potentially sensitive
     information while still attempting to retain enough information to make it
     useful for diagnosing problems or understanding load patterns.  The
     sanitization process operates on fields that consist of name-value pairs.
     The field name is always preserved, but field values might be tokenized or
     redacted if they might include sensitive information.  Supported log file
     types include the file-based access, error, sync, and resync logs, as well
     as the operation timing access log and the detailed HTTP operation log.
     Sanitize the audit log using the scramble-ldif tool.


* schedule-exec-task.bat
     Schedule an exec task to run a specified command in the server.  To run an
     exec task, a number of conditions must be satisfied:  the server's global
     configuration must have been updated to include
     'com.unboundid.directory.server.tasks.ExecTask' in the set of allowed-task
     values, the requester must have the 'exec-task' privilege, and the command
     to execute must be listed in the 'exec-command-whitelist.txt' file in the
     server's config directory.  The absolute path (on the server system) of
     the command to execute must be specified as the first unnamed trailing
     argument to this program, and the arguments to provide to that command (if
     any) should be specified as the remaining trailing arguments.  The server
     root is used as the command's working directory, so any arguments that
     represent relative paths are interpreted as relative to that directory.


* search-and-mod-rate.bat
     Perform repeated searches against an LDAP directory server and modify each
     entry returned.


* search-logs.bat
     Search across log files to extract lines matching the provided patterns,
     like the 'grep' command-line tool. The benefits of using this tool over
     grep are its ability to handle multi line log messages, extract log
     messages within a given time range, and the inclusion of rotated log
     files.


* searchrate.bat
     Perform repeated searches against an LDAP directory server.


* server-state.bat
     View information about the current state of the Directory Server process.

     Calculate the sum of the sizes for a set of files.


* summarize-access-log.bat
     Examine one or more access log files from Ping Identity, UnboundID, or
     Nokia/Alcatel-Lucent 8661 server products to display a number of metrics
     about operations processed within the server.


* transform-ldif.bat
     Apply one or more changes to entries or change records read from an LDIF
     file, writing the updating records to a new file.  This tool can apply a
     variety of transformations, including scrambling attribute values,
     redacting attribute values, excluding attributes or entries, replacing
     existing attributes, adding new attributes, renaming attributes, and
     moving entries from one subtree to another.


* uninstall.bat (deployed in install root)
     Uninstall Ping Identity Directory Server.


* update.bat (deployed in install root)
     Update a deployed server so its version matches the version of this
     package.


* validate-acis.bat
     This tool may be used to validate a set of access control definitions
     contained in an LDAP server (including Sun/Oracle DSEE instances) or an
     LDIF file to determine whether they are acceptable for use in the Ping
     Identity Directory Server.  Note that output generated by this tool will
     be LDIF, but each entry in the output will have exactly one ACI, so
     entries which have more than one ACI will appear multiple times in the
     output with different ACI values.


* validate-file-signature.bat
     Validate file signatures. For best results, file signatures should be
     validated by the same instance used to generate the file. However, it
     might be possible to validate signatures generated on other instances in a
     replicated topology.


* validate-ldif.bat
     Validate the contents of an LDIF file against the server schema.


* verify-index.bat
     Verify that indexes in a backend using the Berkeley DB Java Edition are
     consistent with the entry data contained in the database.


* watch-entry.bat
     Launch a window to watch an LDAP entry for changes.  If the entry changes,
     the background of modified attributes will temporarily be red.  Attributes
     can be modified as well.  This tool is primarily intended to demonstrate
     replication or synchronization functionality.
