20200917203633.101Z	225	Shutting Down
Shutdown initiated by an instance of class com.unboundid.directory.server.monitors.DiskSpaceUsageMonitorProvider with reason The Directory Server has detected that the amount of usable disk space is critically low for components using the following path(s):  '/opt/backup' (totalBytes:  51976810496, usableBytes:  770232320, usablePercent:  1), '/opt/out/instance' (totalBytes:  51976810496, usableBytes:  770199552, usablePercent:  1), '/opt/out/instance/config' (totalBytes:  51976810496, usableBytes:  770355200, usablePercent:  1), '/opt/out/instance/db/changelog' (totalBytes:  51976810496, usableBytes:  770252800, usablePercent:  1), '/opt/out/instance/db/userRoot' (totalBytes:  51976810496, usableBytes:  770215936, usablePercent:  1), '/opt/out/instance/logs' (totalBytes:  51976810496, usableBytes:  770265088, usablePercent:  1).  The Directory Server will now shut itself down to avoid problems which may result from complete exhaustion of usable space
